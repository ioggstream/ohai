--- abstract

To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit
incoming requests, for example based upon the source IP address.  However,
oblivious HTTP removes the ability for the server to distinguish
amongst clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic from the
oblivious proxy.  This harms all clients behind that oblivious proxy.

This specification provides feedback from a server to an oblivious
proxy, enabling the oblivious proxy to rate-limit incoming requests
from clients.  Cooperating oblivious proxies can thus provide more
equitable service to their distinguishable clients without impacting
on all clients behind that Oblivious proxy.

# Introduction

Oblivious HTTP [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp] describes a method of
encapsulation for binary HTTP messages [BINARY] using Hybrid Public
Key Encryption (HPKE; [HPKE]).  This enables a deployment architecture that can
separate the identity of a requester from the request.  This scheme
requires that servers and intermediaries explicitly support it.
The server
is susceptible to the attacks described below, but it cannot 
enact per-client mitigations,
since it has only knowledge of the oblivious
proxy.  Rate-limiting traffic from an oblivious proxy impacts all
clients behind that proxy, whether they are compliant or not with
the server rate-limiting policies.

Attacks against the Request and Target Resources can be classified
into three primary categories:

1.  A client sends a malformed encapsulated request causing
      decryption failure or decryption overload failure on the
      oblivious request resource.  This causes the oblivious request
      resource to send an error status code back to the oblivious
      proxy.

2.  A client sends an HTTP request that causes an HTTP error on
      the oblivious target resource.  This might be a malformed HTTP
      request, or request for a missing resource.,

3.  HTTP flood: A botnet performing an HTTP flood attack against a
      victim's server.  Because each bot in a botnet makes seemingly
      legitimate network requests the traffic is not spoofed and may
      appear "normal" in origin.  This might be too many requests from
      a single client, too many requests from the clients behind the
      same oblivious proxy or too many requests from all clients on the
      Internet.

This document defines how an overload indication is communicated to
an oblivious proxy so that this proxy can rate limit transactions by
overzealous or misbehaving clients, allowing the oblivious proxy to
continue servicing well-behaved clients to that same oblivious target
resource.

"RateLimit Fields for HTTP" specification
[I-D.ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers] allows servers to publish
current service limits to clients, whereas this draft allows servers
to publish current service limits to oblivious proxies.  The former
specification allows clients to shape their request policy and avoid
being throttled out, whereas this specification allows oblivious
proxies to shape their request policy and avoid being throttled out.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The terms 
"Encapsulated request", "Encapsulated response",
"Oblivious proxy resource", "Oblivious request resource",
"Oblivious target resource" are to be interpreted as described
in [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp].

The terms "quota policy" and "RateLimit fields" 
are to be interpreted as described in [I-D.ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers].

This document makes use of terms from [RFC8941].

#  The "oblivous-target" Quota Policy Parameter

The "oblivous-target" parameter is defined for
the RateLimit-Limit field.  It
provides information from the oblivious request resource
or oblivious target resource to the proxy. If 
this parameter is present,
the proxy MUST remove the RateLimit fields
before sending the HTTP response containing
the encapsulated response to the client.  If the RateLimit fields
along with the "oblivous-target" parameter are generated by the
request resource before removing the protection (including being
unable to remove encapsulation for any reason)(Section 6.2 of
[I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp]), it will result in the RateLimit fields added
in the status code being sent without protection in response to a
POST request from a client.

The overall processing of the "oblivous-target" parameter is as
follows:

o  The "oblivous-target" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in
   the quota policy.

o  Proxies MUST ignore any "oblivous-target" parameter, that does not
   conform to the syntax defined in this specification.  In
   particular, proxies MUST NOT attempt to fix malformed "oblivous-
   target" parameters or parameter values.

##  "oblivous-target" Parameter Values

The "oblivous-target" parameter has the following syntax:

oblivous-target = sf-item

where the associated bare-item (Section 3.3 of [RFC8941]) is to
indicate whether the quota policy is applicable to all the clients that
are serviced by the proxy or applicable only to a specific client
and associated parameters are supported.

The bare-item can have the following values:

0x01:  This value indicates that RateLimit fields are applicable to
   all the clients that are serviced by the proxy.

0x02:  This value indicates that RateLimit fields are applicable only
   to the offending client.  For example, this value is used if the
   client is attacking the server (e.g., the client is using an
   abnormal header that matches an attack pattern).  The oblivious
   proxy can potentially rate-limit clients that have a high ratio of
   malicious requests to legitimate requests.

The associated parameter is defined below:

attack-severity = sf-integer

Note that sf-integer is defined in Section 3.3.1 of [RFC8941].

The "attack-severity" parameter indicates the attack severity level.
This attribute takes one of the values defined in Section 3.12.2 of
[RFC7970].

The following example illustrates the use of the new
parameter.  An oblivious target resource receives a malformed message and
uses the source IP address to identify
the sender; moreover it identifies that it was an oblivious HTTP request
decapsulated by the oblivious request resource. 
The Oblivious target resource generates a 400 response and 
adds the RateLimit fields
along with the "oblivous-target" quota policy parameter. 
The request resource:
1. copies the RateLimit fields from the original response;
2. removes them from the original response before encapsulating it;
3. generates a single 200 encapsulated response for the oblivious proxy resource
   along with the copied RateLimit fields.

   The response constructed by the oblivious request resource is
   depicted below:

~~~ http-message

   =============== NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792 ================

The comment in the RateLimit-Limit field is informative (Section 4 of
[I-D.ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers]) and provides a description of
the attack.

#  Request or Target Resource Generating oblivious-target

When an oblivious request or target resource wants to communicate
quota policy information to a client, it
MAY add a RateLimit-Limit field with a "oblivous-target" quota policy parameter to
request load adjustment.  For example, when an HTTP server identifies
itself a high frequency or high volume anomalies in the traffic
directed to the server it would include the "oblivous-target"
parameter.  The RateLimit fields provides enough detail to the
oblivious proxy to avoid being throttled out.

#  Proxy Processing of "oblivous-target" Parameter

When receiving RateLimit-Limit fields containing
an "oblivous-target" quota policy parameter, the proxy can process the 
RateLimit fields and take appropriate actions.  There is no mechanism for
the proxy to indicate to the server that feedback information was
processed or was ignored.  The proxy can honor the rate indicated by
the request resource/resource target.  To that aim, the proxy may
take appropriate additional actions such as (1) rate-limiting the
requests from a client (2) rate-limit all the clients that are
serviced by the proxy.

If the proxy ignores the rate-limit information, there is a risk that
the overload may still be encountered by the request and target
resources.  More severe actions may be, then, taken at the server,
e.g., block all the requests from this proxy for a given time
duration.

#  Security Considerations

The security considerations for the Oblivious HTTP protocol are
discussed in Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp].  The client needs to
trust the proxy that it does not leak the client identity to the
server.  The target and request resources SHOULD convey the
RateLimit-Limit field and "oblivous-target" parameter to trusted
oblivious proxy.  However, if this oblivious proxy is not trusted,
security risks discussed below may arise:

o  If oblivious proxy and clients attacking the server are managed by
   an attacker, the attacker can use the rate-limit information to
   identify the server has detected the attack and possibly change
   the attack strategy.

o  The oblivious proxy can collude with the attacking clients and
   leak the rate-limit information to the clients.

Security considerations specific to the RateLimit-Limit field are
discussed in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers].

#  IANA Considerations

##  RateLimit Parameter Value Registrations

This specification requests IANA to add the following
parameters to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) RateLimit
Parameters" registry defined in [I-D.ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers].
