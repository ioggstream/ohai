                        Oblivious Proxy Feedback
                  draft-rdb-ohai-feedback-to-proxy-00

Abstract

   To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit
   incoming requests, often by source IP address.  However Oblivious
   HTTP removes the ability for the server to distinguish amongst
   clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic from the Oblivious
   proxy.  This harms all clients behind that Oblivious proxy.

   This specification provides feedback from the server to the Oblivious
   proxy, enabling the Oblivious proxy to rate-limit incoming requests
   from clients.  Cooperating Oblivious proxies can thus provide more
   equitable service to their distinguishable clients without triggering
   rate-limiting on the request resource or the target resource that
   would impact all clients behind that Oblivious proxy.

1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp] describes a method of
   encapsulation for binary HTTP messages [BINARY] using Hybrid Public
   Key Encryption (HPKE; [HPKE]).  This protects the content of both
   requests and responses and enables a deployment architecture that can
   separate the identity of a requester from the request.  This scheme
   requires that servers and proxies explicitly support it.  The server
   is susceptible to attacks described below but it cannot take any
   mitigation action per client to protect itself from various attacks
   -- the server can only take mitigation per Oblivious proxy.  Rate
   limiting traffic from an Oblivious proxy impacts all clients behind
   that proxy -- both misbehaving clients and well-behaved clients.

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Proxy Feedback              March 2022


   Attacks against the OHAI infrastructure on the server side belong in
   two primary categories:

   1.  client sends malformed OHAI-encrypted message causing decryption
       failure or decryption overload failure on the OHAI Target
       Resource.  This causes the Target Resource to send an OHAI error
       message back to the OHAI proxy.

   2.  client sends HTTP transaction that causes an HTTP error on the
       target HTTP server (typically a 5xx-series error).  This might be
       a malformed HTTP request, request for a missing resource, too
       many requests from a single client, too many requests from the
       clients behind the same OHAI proxy, or too many requests from all
       clients on the Internet.

   This document defines how overload is communicated to an OHAI proxy
   so that OHAI porxy can rate limit transactions by by overzealous or
   misbehaving clients, allowing the OHAI proxy to continue servicing
   well-behaved clients to that same OHAI target resourvce.

   The server and proxy do not need any prior agreement to use the
   protocol described in this document -- which contrasts with DOTS
   [RFC9132].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in Oblivious HTTP
   [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp].

3.  Feedback Header

   The "Feedback" header field is defined in this specification.  The
   Feedback header provides feedback information from the request
   resource or target resource to the proxy in the HTTP response.  The
   proxy MUST remove the Feedback header before sending the HTTP
   response containing the encapsulated response to the client.  If the
   feedback information is generated by the request resource before
   removing the protection (including being unable to remove
   encapsulation for any reason)(see Section 6.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp]), it will result in the Feedback Header added
   in the status code being sent without protection in response to the
   POST request from the client.

   Figure 1 describes the syntax (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) of the
   header field, using the grammar defined in [RFC5234] and the rules
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7230].  The field values of the header
   field conform to the same rules.

     Feedback = feedback-parameter *( *OWS ";" *OWS feedback-parameter)
     feedback-parameter   =
             feedback-parameter-name [ "=" feedback-parameter-value ]
     feedback-parameter-name = registered-token
     registered-token = token
     feedback-parameter-value = 1*DIGIT

                     Figure 1: Feedback Header Syntax

      [[NOTE: CHECK IF WE CAN REUSE THE STRUCTURED FIELDS IN RFC
      rfc8941]]

   Optional white space (OWS) is used as defined in Section 3.2.3 of
   [RFC7230] and token are used as defined in Section 3.2.6 of
   [RFC7230].

   The overall processing of the parameters are discussed below:

   1.  The order of appearance of the parameters is not significant.

   2.  A given parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in the Feedback
       header.

   3.  Parameters are either optional or required, as explicited in
       their definitions.

   4.  Parameter names are case insensitive.

   5.  Proxies MUST ignore any parameters or values, that do not conform
       to the syntax defined in this specification.  In particular,
       Proxies must not attempt to fix malformed parameters or parameter
       values.

   6.  If the parameter is not recognized by the proxy, it MUST be
       ignored by the proxy.

4.  Feedback Header Parameters

   The feedback information includes the following parameters:

   c-req:  The maximum number of HTTP requests allowed per second per
      client.  This is a optional parameter.

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Proxy Feedback              March 2022


   c-outstanding:  The maximum number of outstanding HTTP requests
      allowed per client.  This is an optional attribute.

   p-req:  The maximum number of HTTP requests allowed per second from
      the proxy.  This is an optional attribute.

   p-outstanding:  The maximum number of outstanding HTTP requests
      allowed from the proxy.  This is an optional attribute.

   td:  The time duration the OHAI target server wants this policy
      applied.  A value of -1 indicates infinity.  A value of 0
      indicates all currently and previously-signaled feedback
      thresholds no longer apply.  Value in seconds.  This is a
      mandatory attribute.

   TBD: Use of any other parameters like min-encap-request-size and max-
   encap-request-size to defend from garbled encapsulated requests.

   TBD: Recommended lifetime of Feedback (3600 seconds) ?

   The above parameters are in the form of a name=value pair.  The
   feedback information header MUST include atleast one of the
   parameters rpsc, orc, rps, orp, rps, or ohr.

   Example:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Date: Wed, 27 March 2022 04:45:07 GMT
     Cache-Control: private, no-store
     Feedback: c-req=1000; p-outstanding=20; td=600
     Content-Length: 38 <content is the encapsulated response>

5.  Request or Target Resource generating Feedback Header

   When an overlaod is experienced by the request or target resource it
   adds the Feedback header and parameters to request load adjustement.
   For example, when a WAF or HTTP server itself identifies high
   frequency or high volume anomalies in the traffic directed to the
   server it would include the Feedback header.  Ideally the Feedback
   header provides enough detail to the Oblivious proxy to avoid the
   server rate limiting the Oblivious proxy's IP address.

6.  Proxy Processing of Feedback Header

   When presented with a response that contains a Feedback Header, the
   proxy can process the parameters in the headers and take appropriate
   action.  There is no mechanism for proxy to indicate to server that
   feedback information was processed or was ignored.  The proxy can

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Proxy Feedback              March 2022


   honor the rate indicated by the request resource/resource target.  To
   that aim, the proxy may take appropriate additional actions such as
   (1) rate-limiting the requests from a client not to exceed requests
   per second (rps) value (2) rate-limit the outstanding HTTP requests
   from a client not to exceed outstanding requests (ohr) value.

   If the proxy ignores the feedback information, there is a risk that
   the overload may still be encountered by the request and target
   resources.  More severe actions may be then taken at the server,
   e.g., block all the requests from this proxy for a given time
   duration.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Oblivious HTTP protocol are
   discussed in Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp].
